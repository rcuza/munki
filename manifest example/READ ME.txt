Still debating whether to call these manifests or catalogs or something else.

Essentially just a simple list of the items to install or verify their installation.

The optional key 'default_branch' defines where to look for items referred to by relative path. I envision this as a way to quickly move a configuration from unstable to stable or vice-versa.

Items can have a relative path, or an "absolute" path.  If they have an "absolute" path, the default_branch is ignored and the item is retrieved from the full path relative to the repo_root/pkgs/:

<dict>
	<key>default_branch</key>
	<string>unstable</string>
	<key>managed_installs</key>
	<array>
		<string>ServerAdminTools</string>
		<string>/stable/TextWrangler</string>
		<string>subfolder/AnotherItem</string>
	</array>
</dict>

ServerAdminTools is requested from: http://webserver/reporoot/pkgs/unstable/ServerAdminTools

TextWrangler is requested from
http://webserver/reporoot/pkgs/stable/TextWrangler

AnotherItem is requested from
http://webserver/reporoot/pkgs/unstable/subfolder/AnotherItem

Subfolders are organizational only and do not provide additional namespace, since the storage on the client is flat:

<dict>
	<key>default_branch</key>
	<string>stable</string>
	<key>managed_installs</key>
	<array>
		<string>TextWrangler</string>
		<string>subfolder/TextWrangler</string>
	</array>
</dict>

would result in the catalogitem "subfolder/TextWrangler" replacing "TextWrangler" on the client, as both would be downloaded to the same path on the client.  This might be considered a misfeature...
