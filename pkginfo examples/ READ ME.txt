Use 'makepkginfo' to create pkginfo files - it does the hard work so you don't have to!

These examples don't show all the supported keys.  Here's a few more:
	
There are three types of dependency/relationship keys.

'requires' are prerequisites: package A requires package B be installed first.
if package A is removed, package B is unaffected.
'requires' is an array of itemnames.

<key>requires</key>
<array>
	<string>TextWrangler</string>
</array>

The format for requires is identical to the managed_installs key in the manifest. 
No checking is done for circular dependencies - so don't make any.


'modifies' points to ONE package the current package modifies on install; generally this means the current package is an updater.  For example, 'Office2008' might resolve to Office2008-12.1.7.0.0 which modifies 
Office2008-12.1.0.0.0 which modifies Office2008--12.0.0.0.0 (Office2008--12.1.7.0.0 and 
Office2008--12.1.0.0.0 are updater packages, Office2008--12.0.0.0.0 is the original installer.)
If you later remove Office2008, you want to remove everything installed by all three packages.
'modifies' provides a method to theoretically figure it all out.
The value for 'modifies' must be a string that unambiguously resolves to a specific version of a specific install:

<key>modifies</key>
<string>Office2008-12.0.0.0.0</string>

when processing installs, the two dependencies are basically equivalent;
the real difference comes when processing removals.

'modifies' has been deprecated and support for it will be removed in 
a future release.

The third type of relationship is "update_for".
This signifies that that current package should be considered an update
for the packages listed in the "update_for" array. When processing a
package, we look through the catalogs for other packages that declare
they are updates for the current package and install them if needed.
This can be a one-to-many relationship - one package can be an update 
for several other packages; for example, "PhotoshopCS4update-11.0.1" 
could be an update for PhotoshopCS4 and for AdobeCS4DesignSuite.

When removing an item, any updates for that item are removed as well.

With 'requires' and 'update_for' you can completely replace the 
functionality of 'modifies', plus do more, so 'modifies' is on its way
out.


Supported architectures:
If an installer item is valid only for PowerPC or only for Intel, you can include a supported_architectures key:

<key>supported_architectures</key>
<array>
	<string>powerpc</string>
	<string>i386</string>
</array>
	
If this key is missing, it is assumed the installer item is valid for both PowerPC and Intel, so generally you'd have only "powerpc" or "i386" here.
