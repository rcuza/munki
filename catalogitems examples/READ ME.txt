Use 'makepkginfo' to create pkginfo files - it does the hard work so you don't have to!

These examples don't show all the supported keys.  Here's a few more:
	
There are two kinds of dependency keys.

'requires' are prerequisites: package A requires package B be installed first.
if package A is removed, package B is unaffected.

'modifies' are packages the current package modifies on install; generally these
are updaters.  For example, 'Office2008' might resolve to Office2008--12.1.7 which modifies 
Office2008--12.1.0 which modifies Office2008--12.0.0. (Office2008--12.1.7 and 
Office2008--12.1.0 are updater packages, Office2008--12.0.0 is the original installer.)
If you later remove Office2008, you want to remove everything installed by all three packages.
'modifies' provides a method to theoretically figure it all out.  
'modifies' is a superset of 'requires'.

when processing installs, the two dependencies are basically equivalent;
the real difference comes when processing removals.

<key>requires</key>
<array>
	<string>TextWrangler</string>
</array>

The format for dependencies is identical to the managed_installs key in the manifest. 
No checking is done for circular dependencies - so don't make any.
