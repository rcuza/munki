The tools get their configuration from /Library/Preferences/ManagedInstalls.plist

Currently only three values are defined, and if the file is missing managedinstalls.py uses these defaults:

prefs['managed_install_dir'] = "/Library/Managed Installs"
prefs['manifest_url'] = "http:/managedinstalls/cgi-bin/getmanifest"
prefs['sw_repo_url'] = "http://managedinstalls/swrepo"


You'll want to edit for your own use.
